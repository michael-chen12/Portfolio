   - Scales and morphs on interactive elements
   - Creates a unique, memorable interaction pattern

2. **Advanced Animations**
   - Parallax effects responding to mouse movement
   - 3D card tilt effects on hover
   - Staggered reveal animations
   - Organic floating decorations
   - Shimmer and gradient effects

3. **Atmospheric Backgrounds**
   - Animated gradient meshes
   - Noise texture overlays
   - Radial gradients that follow mouse movement
   - Layered transparency effects

4. **Sophisticated Micro-interactions**
   - Magnetic hover effects on cards
   - Animated underlines that draw in
   - Icon rotations and scales
   - Button shine effects
   - Number counter animations

## 🎭 Design Principles Applied

### Typography
- **Sora**: Bold, geometric display font for headings
- **Inter**: Clean, readable body font
- Gradient text effects on key phrases
- Animated decorative underlines

### Color Palette
- **Teal** (#5CB5B5): Primary brand color

- **Cream** (#FAFAF9): Base background

### Spatial Composition
- Asymmetric hero layout
- Grid-breaking floating elements
- Generous whitespace
- Overlapping cards with depth

### Motion Design
- Parallax depth on scroll
- 3D transforms on cards
- Staggered entrance animations
- Magnetic cursor following
- Organic floating elements

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Framer Motion Integration
- `useMotionValue` for mouse tracking
- `useTransform` for parallax effects
- `useSpring` for smooth animations
- `whileInView` for scroll triggers
- 3D transforms with `preserve-3d`

### Performance Optimizations
- Animation triggers only on viewport entry
- Reduced motion media query support
- Efficient event listeners
- Optimized re-renders

### Accessibility
- Custom focus states (teal rings)
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- Skip to content for screen readers

## 🎯 What Makes This Memorable

1. **Custom Cursor**: Immediately sets this apart from standard portfolios
2. **3D Card Effects**: Professional depth and polish
3. **Gradient Text**: Distinctive visual signature
4. **Animated Numbers**: Editorial magazine feel in services section
5. **Floating Elements**: Adds life and energy to static sections
6. **Success Animation**: Delightful feedback on form submission
7. **Mouse-Reactive Backgrounds**: Subtle but engaging interactivity

## 📱 Responsive Design

All enhanced features gracefully degrade on mobile:
- Custom cursor disabled on touch devices
- 3D effects simplified for performance
- Stacked layouts on smaller screens
- Touch-optimized interactive elements
